Aspiring Software Engineer & Robotics Developer | React.js Enthusiast | Machine Learning Explorer

## About Me
I'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in robotics, frontend development, and AI. I thrive at the intersection of software and hardwareâ€”building systems that are not only functional but also intuitive and human-centered.

Currently based in Joensuu, Finland, I'm working on projects that bridge user experience, autonomous systems, and intelligent agents. My background includes both computer science and hands-on experience in robotics and web development.
