# salutations guzz (github huzz)!, im josh👾
- hailing from the digital cosmos, where 404s are black holes, I emerge as a self-proclaimed Pixel Shaman!🧙‍♂️
- dunking data structures by day, summoning robotic minions by night. 🤖

## what im working on rn
- 🔮 i blend design and functionality, channeling React.js and robotic arms into user-friendly magic.
- 💻 training machines (or im trying to... at least), not to take over the world (yet), but to play chess better than me.
- 🚁 i’m currently building an autonomous ArduCopter drone with the goal of integrating machine learning for smart navigation and obstacle avoidance. 

## ⚡ fun facts:
- i've probably written more lines of console.log than actual functioning code.
- i firmly believe every robot deserves a cool name. My current sidekick? PincherX the Armageddon.
- when im not on chatgpt (doing my assignments), i'm shootin' hoops or pretending to understand chess strategies.
